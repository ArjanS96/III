"You dash toward the gap. The creature sees you and leaps behind you, but the
gap isn't large enough for the creature. The creature tries to force itself
through the wall, but destabilizes the structure. The shed falls on it, pinning
it to the ground.

You walk, until the shed is out of sight. You sit down on the grass. The fog has
cleared and dawn arrives.

A swallow glides in to perch on your shoulder. In what seems like a flash,
you awake.
